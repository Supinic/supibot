| **Discord server** | Supibot has hit the limit of 100 servers on Discord, and getting more unfortunately requires to ["dox"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing) myself to become a verified developer. Feel free to PM me on Discord after joining my [Discord server](https://supinic.com/contact) for up-to-date info. |

## Running own instance
It's possible to host your own instance of supibot. You can either set it up as a node app manually, or use the docker image.

Follow [the guide](docs/setup.md) if you are interested, and contact me if you have any questions or notes.

## DankChat integration
The [DankChat](https://github.com/flex3r/DankChat) mobile application for Twitch chat uses Supibot's API in order to hint its commands in any channel Supibot is actively in!
It's a wonderful app to use on the go, and I endorse it.
