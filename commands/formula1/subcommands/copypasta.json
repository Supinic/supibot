  "I was at a jousting festival but my weapon kept breaking! When I drove it forward into my opponents chest, it would snap under the pressure! It was only till my father used his money to fix it that it would work. That's right! Lance only drives well with daddy's money!",
  "I was born and raised at the Red Bull Ring. My grandfather used to tell me stories about RBMan, a sloth from Holland that travels to Austria for every race there. He statpads a win then disappears until the next Austrian GP. I still have nightmares that he's hiding at our track",

  "Anyways, um... I bought a whole bunch of halo devices, do you know what a halo is? Anybody know what a halo is? No not Halo ODST, I think that game is dead. I'm talking halo protection device. Anyways, it's a one ton, like titanium carbon fibre structure that protects against unwanted collisions and flying tyres that may be traveling in the air. That's my story, I bought a whole bunch of stuff. Put em around the la coche. Little halos, stuff like that.",
  "Late in the asylum for psychological disorders, lost in conversation with a reporter, wailing deep into the night just like a grieving mourner, \"YOU SHOULD NEVER, STICK A WHEEL, INSIDE OF COPSE CORNER\". And for 30 years that's all he said. Poor Christian Horner.",

  "The Scuderia isnt just a place. It's a sanctuary where we put our problems aside and enjoy firing all our best drivers. You've ruined more careers than you think, Mr. Sbinotto.",
  "The wheels of my motor vehicle have lost their grip on the tarmac and resulted in a loss of traction. This has made my vehicle turn 360 degrees upon its axis and severely hurt my chances in this race.",
  "At least Niki Lauda has the fucking balls to say it. Like in Italy in the ferrari factory if you build an f1 car it is automatically \"fast\". Nevermind that it understeers like crazy and the weight distribution is a disaster.",
  "After what I saw this F1 season, I've seen enough. The only way you can think Max Crashtappen is better than Lewis is if you've been brainwashed at a young age. Lewis is doing everything Max Fraudstappen could, but better. Lewis Hamilton is my GOAT and yours as well. Goodnight.",

  "I was at a theme park in Zandvoort when I heard a grown man cry and screaming. When I came closer, I saw that Lewis Hamilton was afraid to enter the haunted house called \"Verstappen highlights 2021\". He went back to gamble and won everything!! Not suprised, he is always lucky!!!",
