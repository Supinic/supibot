# Setup

## Docker 

The easiest way to get started is to use a `docker-compose` file, which includes all the needed services.

To start off:
1) Copy `config-default.json` as `config.json`
2) In the config file, configure:
   - Your desired platform(s)
   - Anything regarding bot behaviour: commands, chat modules, logging, ... 
3) Copy `docker-compose.example.yaml` as `docker-compose.yaml`
4) In the compose file, set up:
   - Bot environment values, and the authentication info as needed (see below for specific platforms)
   - Absolute path to the freshly created `./config.json` file (`<path_to_supibot_repository>`)
   - Uncomment the `DEBUG_MODE` environment value for debugging 
5) Run Docker: `docker compose up`
6) For debugging:
   1) In your host machine's browser, navigate to `chrome://inspect`
   2) Add `localhost:9229`
   3) Open the console via `Remote Target → inspect`

### Authentication guides

#### Twitch

1. Create an application: [guide on Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app/)
2. Note your `Client ID` and `Client secret` tokens
3. Visit [this website](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/) for token generation, pick "Custom Scope Token"
4. Fill in the section `Use My Client Secret and Client ID` with the tokens from step 2
5. Allow token scopes: 
   - `user:bot` `user:read:chat` `user:write:chat` to read and send messages (**required**)
   - `user:read:emotes` to fetch the bot's own emotes (**suggested**)
   - `user:manage:whispers` for whispers (private messages) functionality (**suggested**)
   - `channel:moderate` for moderation actions (**optional**)
6. Fill in the env values in the compose file accordingly:
   - `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`
   - `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `TWITCH_REFRESH_TOKEN`

#### Discord

1. Create an application: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Navigate to `Application → Bot`
3. Note the `Token` (will only be available to copy once) and `Application ID`
4. Set up the `Privileged Gateway Intents`: `Server members` and `Message content`
5. Fill in the `Application ID` into your `config.json`'s discord platform, as the `selfId` property
6. Fill in the env values in the compose file with your `Token`:
   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`

## CLI

Setting Supibot up locally requires several steps, and is much easier if done with an interactive script.

### Interactive script

1) Set up `MariaDB` of at least version `10.2.0` and credentials. Ideally, create a user separate for Supibot that has permissions on `data` and `chat_data` databases.
2) Set up `Redis`
3) `git clone` or `fork` the repository
4) Run `yarn install`, depending on which package manager you use
5) Run `yarn run setup` and walk through the interactive setup script, making sure to set up at least one platform, one channel and the command prefix
6) Run `yarn start`, or `yarn debug` for debug access

### Manual

Alternatively, if `run setup` does not work or for whatever other reason, follow this manual setup:

#### Groundwork

1) Set up `MariaDB` of at least version `10.2.0` + credentials
2) Set up `Redis`
3) `git clone` or `fork` the repository
4) Copy `.example.env` as `.env` and fill out all relevant env variables, including authentication credentials
5) Run `yarn install`
6) Run `yarn run init-database`
7) Run `yarn start` to verify that the bot can start up correctly. If it does, it will not attempt to join any platforms or channels. In order to do so, continue:
8) Copy `config-default.json` as `config.json` and fill out your custom configuration, especially regarding desired platforms
9) Set up at least one channel per platform to `chat_data.Channel` table, by inserting a new row, and filling the channel's `Name`, `Specific_ID` and `Platform`
10) Run the bot as in **7)**, or `yarn run debug` for debug access

#### Adjustments

In order to set yourself as the `administrator` of Supibot:

1) Make sure you have been seen by the bot - check the `chat_data.User_Alias` table, find your name, and note the user ID
2) Create a new row in the `chat_data.User_Alias_Data` table: 
  - `User_Alias` is the ID you noted
  - `Property` is `administrator`
  - `Value` is `true`
3) Changes should apply immediately, in case they don't, restart the bot
